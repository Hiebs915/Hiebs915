### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Matt Hiebing.  I have a Masters and Bachelors of Science and am a professionally trained scientist from a Fortune 500 energy exploration company with a passion for technology, automation, robotics, software development, coding, and mechanical keyboards.  I am a life-long learner with a passion for building things and understanding how they work.

During previous jobs, I used proprietary coding software to automate day-to-day tasks where human-error could easily creep into your workflows.  This is where my coding passion began.  I quickly adopted our in-house software and became the go-to-guy for automating laborious project workflows.  I shared these workflows with coworkers and saved people countless hours throughout their day.  Aside from automation tasks, I also completed projects in data analysis, machine learning, and database management.  Recently, I've made it a goal to learn new non-proprietary software in web development and data science so I can more easily share my projects with others.

I currently work for the Utah Division of Oil, Gas, and Mining as their Information Services Manager.  I manage projects between in-house staff and software development teams across the US to get our Oil & Gas division upto and beyond the level of our competitor states.
