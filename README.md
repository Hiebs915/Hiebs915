### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Matt Hiebing.  I have a Masters and Bachelors of Science and am a professionally trained scientist from a Fortune 500 Energy Exploration Company with a passion for technology, automation, robotics, project building, and coding.  I am a life-long-learner with a passion for building things and understanding how they work.  In previous jobs, I used proprietary coding software to automate day-to-day tasks where human-error could creep into your workflows.  I've also completed projects in data analysis, machine learning, and database management.  Recently, I've made a goal of learning new non-proprietary software in web development and data science fields so I can more easily share my projects with others.

- Iâ€™m currently learning about Data Science, Data Analytics, and Full Stack Web Development through Udemy and YouTube courses.
- Some of my current projects include: an automated unemployment payment request project and an online game for 3rd graders to practice their math skills.
