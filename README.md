### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Matt Hiebing.  I have a Masters and Bachelors of Science and am a professionally trained scientist from a Fortune 500 Energy Exploration Company with a passion for technology, automation, robotics, project building, and coding.  I am a life long learner that loves the union of mechanics and electronics, as well as the subsequent code that controls these two fields.  In previous jobs I've used proprietary coding software to automate some of my day-to-day tasks where human-error was common.  I've also completed projects in data analysis, 3D modeling, and database management.  I am trying to learn more software' that is publicly available and easier to share with others.

- Iâ€™m currently learning about Data Science, Data Analytics, and Full Stack Web Development through Udemy and YouTube courses.
- Some of my current projects include: an automated unemployment payment request project and an online game for 3rd graders to practice their math skills.
