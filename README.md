### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a professionally trained scientist from a Fortune 500 Energy Exploration Company with a passion for technology, automation, robotics, and coding.  I've used proprietary coding software to automate some of my day-to-day tasks where human-error was common but I'm trying to learn more software that is publicly available and easier to share with others.

- Iâ€™m currently learning about Data Science, Data Analytics, and Full Stack Web Development through Udemy and YouTube courses.
- Some of my current projects include: an automated unemployment payment request project and an online game for 3rd graders to practice their math skills.
