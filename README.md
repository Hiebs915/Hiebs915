### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a professionally trained geologist from a Fortune 500 Energy Exploration Company with an interest in coding.  I've used proprietary software to automate my day-to-day tasks at work but I would like to incorporate new software and techniques that can be shared within the tech industry. 

- Iâ€™m currently learning about Data Science, Data Analytics, and Full Stack Web Development through Udemy and YouTube courses.
- Some of my current projects include: an automated unemployment payment request project and an online game for 3rd graders to practice their math skills.
