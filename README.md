### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a trained geologist with an interest in coding.  Eventually, I would like to incorporate coding in my day-to-day work tasks.

- Iâ€™m currently learning about Data Science, Data Analytics, and Full Stack Web Development through Udemy and YouTube courses.
- Some of my current projects include: an automated unemployment payment request project and an online game for 3rd graders to practice their math skills.
